## Quick Start

### 1. **Set Your API Key**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# or create .env file
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
```

### 2. **Run CoCo**
```bash
# Basic monitoring
./target/release/coco

# With session recording
./target/release/coco record
```

### 3. **Edit Code & Watch Magic**
Open any supported file (`.rs`, `.py`, `.js`, `.go`, etc.) and see AI analysis in real-time!

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q`, `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` | Quit application |
| `v` | Toggle view modes |
| `c` | Clear AI thoughts |
| `y` / `n` | Accept/reject suggestions |
| `h` | Show help |
| `r` | Refresh analysis |

---

## Architecture

CoCo is built with a **modular Rust architecture** for maximum performance and reliability:

```
CoCo v2.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App Core          # Central state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Terminal UI       # Rich TUI with ratatui
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI Integration    # Claude API with retry logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File Watcher      # Real-time file monitoring
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Session System    # Recording & replay
```

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Async-first design** with Tokio
- **Zero-copy string processing**
- **Memory-safe concurrency** with Arc<Mutex>
- **Intelligent debouncing** to prevent analysis spam
- **Robust error handling** with graceful degradation

---

## View Modes

1. **Side-by-Side** - Code and thoughts side by side
2. **Full View** - Code on top, thoughts below
3. **Minimal** - Essential information only
4. **Thoughts Only** - AI analysis full screen

---

## Performance

- **Binary Size**: 3.2MB (optimized release)
- **Memory Usage**: ~10-50MB during operation
- **File Processing**: 10x faster than Node.js equivalents
- **UI Rendering**: 20 FPS smooth updates
- **Startup Time**: <100ms cold start

## AI Analysis Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Analyzing** | Code structure analysis |
| **Suggesting** | Improvement recommendations |
| **Warning** | Potential issues |
| **Error** | Bugs and problems |
| **Performance** | Speed optimizations |
| **Security** | Vulnerability checks |
| **Style** | Code formatting |
| **Architecture** | Design patterns |
